Self-Critique:
With the project, I was responsible for the registration/pin entry page. I initially attempted to utilize JavaScript to both validate the pin and direct to the add/drop page if the pin was correct. Due to a implementation of JavaScript for the login screen, my JavaScript would not properly read variables from that script, nor properly direct users, so in the end I had to, disappointingly, remove the validation JS and just have the page direct through. I feel like I did adequate work on this project, and that I have grown my knowledge of both design and function in this class, I just believe that I need to go back and learn more about JavaScript.

Group critique:
I thought that all group members did great and adequate work. Everyone did the work that was agreed on. Everyone communicated properly and worked together to get this project done.
